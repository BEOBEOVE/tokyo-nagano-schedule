# Daily Schedule Web App Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Create a web application to browse a daily travel schedule based on a provided Google Sheet. The app will show daily summaries, detailed itineraries with Google Maps links, and weather forecasts with clothing suggestions.

## User Review Required
- **Data Source**: The app will use a static JSON file generated from the Google Sheet. Updates to the sheet will not automatically reflect in the app unless the JSON is regenerated.
- **Weather**: Weather forecasts will be fetched from OpenMeteo API based on the location of the day.
- **Maps**: Google Maps links will be generated based on location names if not explicitly found in the sheet.

## Proposed Changes

### Data Layer
#### [NEW] [schedule_data.json](file:///C:/Users/amyni/.gemini/antigravity/brain/bc479f62-af37-4067-a14a-0975bbe589a3/src/data/schedule_data.json)
- JSON file containing the parsed schedule:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "date": "2026-03-28",
      "day": "Day 1",
      "title": "抵達東京 → 輕井澤",
      "location": "Karuizawa",
      "items": [
        { "time": "06:35", "activity": "抵達東京成田機場...", "location": "Narita Airport", "mapLink": "..." }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```

### Frontend (React + Vite)
#### [NEW] [App.jsx](file:///C:/Users/amyni/.gemini/antigravity/brain/bc479f62-af37-4067-a14a-0975bbe589a3/src/App.jsx)
- Main layout component.
- Handles routing (if using Router) or State for View switching (List vs Detail).

#### [NEW] [components/ScheduleList.jsx](file:///C:/Users/amyni/.gemini/antigravity/brain/bc479f62-af37-4067-a14a-0975bbe589a3/src/components/ScheduleList.jsx)
- Displays the list of days.
- Shows weather summary for each day.

#### [NEW] [components/DayDetail.jsx](file:///C:/Users/amyni/.gemini/antigravity/brain/bc479f62-af37-4067-a14a-0975bbe589a3/src/components/DayDetail.jsx)
- Shows detailed timeline for a selected day.
- Clickable items to open Google Maps.
- Hourly weather forecast (if available/feasible) or detailed daily forecast.

- Functions to fetch weather from OpenMeteo.
- Mapping of Location Names to Coordinates (e.g., Karuizawa -> 36.34, 138.63).

#### [MODIFY] [styles/main.css](file:///C:/Users/amyni/.gemini/antigravity/brain/bc479f62-af37-4067-a14a-0975bbe589a3/src/styles/main.css)

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- **Linting**: `npm run lint` to ensure code quality.
- **Build**: `npm run build` to verify the app builds correctly.

### Manual Verification
- **Data Accuracy**: Compare the displayed schedule with the Google Sheet.
- **Links**: Click every map link to ensure it opens the correct location.
- **Weather**: Verify weather data loads and looks reasonable (e.g., not showing 50°C for Japan in March).
- **Responsiveness**: Check UI on mobile and desktop viewports (using Browser DevTools).
- **[NEW] Visuals**: Verify timeline connection and smooth expansion animation.
