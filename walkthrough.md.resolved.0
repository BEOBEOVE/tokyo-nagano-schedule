# Daily Schedule Web App Walkthrough

I have successfully created and deployed the Daily Schedule Web App for the Tokyo-Nagano trip.

## Features
- **Daily Schedule**: Browse the itinerary day by day.
- **Detail View**: Click on any day to see detailed activities.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Click on location names to open them in Google Maps.
- **Weather & Clothing**: Shows weather forecasts and clothing suggestions (mocked for 2026).
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop.

## Deployment
The app is deployed to GitHub Pages.
- **Repository**: [tokyo-nagano-schedule](https://github.com/BEOBEOVE/tokyo-nagano-schedule)
- **Live URL**: https://BEOBEOVE.github.io/tokyo-nagano-schedule/ (It may take a few minutes to be live)

## Verification
I verified the app locally using the browser tool.
